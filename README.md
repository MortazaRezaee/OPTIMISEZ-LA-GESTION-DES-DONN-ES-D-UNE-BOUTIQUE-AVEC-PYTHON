# OPTIMISEZ-LA-GESTION-DES-DONNEES-D'UNE-BOUTIQUE-AVEC-PYTHON
Welcome to the BottleNeck Data Integration and Analysis project repository. As a freelance data analyst, your mission is to help BottleNeck, a prestigious wine merchant, enhance its sales data management by integrating ERP and e-commerce datasets for better business insights.

Project Overview
BottleNeck is currently facing challenges in managing its sales and stock data due to a lack of integration between their ERP system and their online store. Your mission involves:

Data Integration:

Combine data from the ERP (containing product references, prices, and stock levels) with data from the e-commerce platform (including product names, descriptions, and sales figures).
Utilize an Excel file created by a previous intern, Sylvie, which provides a mapping between the ERP product IDs and the SKU references in the e-commerce platform.
Sales Analysis:

Calculate the revenue per product and the total online revenue after data integration.
Anomaly Detection:

Conduct an analysis to identify potential pricing errors by detecting outliers in the product price data.
Create visualizations to clearly present any discrepancies found.
Deliverables
Data Integration Notebook: A Python or R notebook that performs data cleaning, merging, and initial analysis.
Sales Report: A report or dashboard that presents the calculated revenue metrics.
Anomaly Detection Visualization: A graphical representation of pricing anomalies for easy identification and reporting.
